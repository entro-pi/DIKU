Since you are here, you can serve as witnesses to the final test\nof the new mages' spell:  \"ectowatt\".'  With this he makes a magical gesture\nand a paladin appears.  Crossing his fingers, Froboz waves the wand his\ndirection and what happens next is incredible!  The Paladin is enveloped in\nwhat appears to be a small, well contained, thermonuclear explosion.  When\nthe smoke clears you can see that the paladin and all of equipment has been\nreduced to a large pile of flaming cinders.  Froboz throws his head back and\ncackles with insane glee.
